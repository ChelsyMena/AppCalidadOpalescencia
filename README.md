# 📸 Webcam Image Classifier with Keras & Plotly

## 🚀 Overview
This project uses **Plotly Dash** to create an interactive web app that allows the user to open their webcam, capture an image, and run it through a **Keras** model to classify whether it's **acceptable** or **not**.

Once the image is classified, the app displays the result to the user and prompts them to input an observation, which is then saved along with the predictions into a text file for further analysis.

## 💻 Features
- Open your webcam directly from the app.
- Capture an image and run it through a Keras `.h5` model.
- Classify the image as **acceptable** or **not**.
- Save the predictions and observations in a text file for record-keeping.

## 📸 How It Works
1. **Webcam Capture:** The user can open their webcam within the app.
2. **Image Classification:** The captured image is passed through the pre-trained **Keras** model to predict its category.
3. **Display Result:** The prediction ("acceptable" or "not") is displayed on the screen.
4. **User Observation:** The user is prompted to input a short observation about the image.
5. **Save Data:** The prediction and the observation are saved to a text file for future use or analysis.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Plotly Dash**: Interactive front-end to display and capture webcam images.
- **Keras (with TensorFlow)**: Pre-trained model to classify images.
- **OpenCV**: For accessing and controlling the webcam.
